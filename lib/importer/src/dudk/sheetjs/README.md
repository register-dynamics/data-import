Contained herein is a modified copy of [SheetJS](https://sheetjs.com), to which we (Register Dynamics)
have added the ability to read defined tables from .xlsx files.

[Our diffs to the SheetJS source code are available in our clone of the repository onto github](https://github.com/register-dynamics/sheetjs-with-defined-tables/tree/excel-defined-tables).
