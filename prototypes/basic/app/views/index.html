      This demonstration service enables you to upload your monthly pension return as a
      single spreadsheet to show how your service could submit multiple records in a single transaction.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      By uploading your pension returns on a monthly basis we are able to keep
      current data and future projections up to date, ensuring that you and your
      staff are kept as up to date as possible
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      To begin, you will need a spreadsheet or comma-separated file containing the previous month's
      employee salaries alongside their employee reference number and personal details. After uploading
      your file you will need to choose which sheet contains the data, and then  you will need to tell
      us which fields in your spreadsheet are associated with the following fields:

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Title</li>
          <li>First name</li>
          <li>Surname</li>
          <li>Employee number</li>
          <li>Employment start date</li>
          <li>Salary (required)</li>
          <li>Payment date</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The Salary field is required. If you do not provide a salary in a particular row, an error message will be shown
      providing context for where the error occurs.  Processing will continue, but the row will not be imported.
      You can then correct the error and re-upload the file.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The following sample files are provided to demonstrate the upload process.
      You can use these files to explore the service without needing to create your own data.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      <strong>Sample file 1:</strong> <a href="/download/pensions-data-sample.xlsx" class="govuk-link">pensions-data-sample.xlsx</a>
      - an Excel spreadsheet containing 10 records with no errors.

      <form action="{{ importerSamplePath('/select_sheet') }}" method="post">
        <input type="hidden" name="samplefile" value="pensions-data-sample.xlsx">
        <input type="submit" class="govuk-button govuk-button--secondary" value="Use pensions-data-sample.xlsx" name="submit">
      </form>

    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      <strong>Sample file 2:</strong> <a href="/download/tribbles.xlsx" class="govuk-link">tribbles.xlsx</a>
      - an Excel spreadsheet containing my favourite Star Trek aliens.

      <form action="{{ importerSamplePath('/select_sheet') }}" method="post">
        <input type="hidden" name="samplefile" value="tribbles.xlsx">
        <input type="submit" class="govuk-button govuk-button--secondary" value="Use tribbles.xlsx" name="submit">
      </form>

    </p>


    <p class="govuk-body">
      On completion, you will be provided with a reference number for the upload which should be quoted
      in any correspondence about this process.
    </p>
